# Customer Segmentation

<p align="justify">In this notebook we will analyze and cluster customer data taken from an anonymous private enterprise. Data consist of 2,000 records with respect to the customer ID, Sex, Marital Status, Age, Education, Income, Occupation and Residence Size. First we conduct an exploratory analysis, getting information about and from the distribution of the data. We also observe and visualize certain data behaviors and correlations between them. We engineer a new feature from those given by the raw data, in order to delve deeper on how much value we can obtain from our findings, that later on will prove helpful to the data scientist and his/her company. Finally, we construct our model. The purpose of the model is group data with similar traits and behaviors into clusters. We then evaluate the model and visualize it for a better understanding of its results.</p>
